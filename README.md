2. Update the paths in all the scripts to point to where you downloaded this repository. ie replace "/path/to/folder" to where you have the `/reddit-to-epub/` directory.
this should be updated in the following files:
    1. index.js
    2. run_scripts.sh

3. Running All Scripts:
This script updates the base cover image with the current date, generates the ePub from the Reddit RSS feed, and sends it to your Kindle email address  by calling the afformentioned files.

```
./run_scripts.sh
```

**Automating with Cron**

To automate the process, you can set up a cron job that runs the scripts at a specified interval (e.g., daily). Hereâ€™s how to set up a cron job on a Unix-like system:

Open the crontab file for editing:

```
crontab -e
```

Add the following line to schedule the job (e.g., daily at 7 AM):

```
0 7 * * * /home/jstriblet/Desktop/reddit-to-epub/run_scripts.sh
```

Save and exit the crontab editor.
